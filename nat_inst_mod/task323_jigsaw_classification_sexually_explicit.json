            "output": "Sexual-explicit",
            "explanation": "The sentence is toxic as it involves explicit references to genitalia in a derogatory context, making it inappropriate and explicit. The mention of \"vagina\" and the context of the bathroom debate introduce sexual content, justifying the label Sexual-explicit."

The ideologies behind this movement range from the crudest interpretations of Christianity to the most virulently racist expressions such as those pronounced by Trump's fellow real estate developer and close friend Paladino about President Obama having sexual relations with animals and the First Lady being an animal.

This healthcare thing is a powerful lesson in that.  \nTrump took a political \"certainty\" (repeal of Obamacare by a GOP that controlled both houses of Congress and the WH) and politically undermined it.  \nIt started back in 2016, when he turned repeal into an unthinking imperative.  That was a mistake born of ignorance.  He did not understand healthcare complexities.  He (and the GOP) should have heralded a more deliberate approach instead of an \"immediate\" \"first act on first day of my Presidency\" approach.\nAlong the way, he cemented the failure.  He attacked so many, it is surprising 49 GOP Senators actually voted \"Yes\" last night.  Ultimately, his misogyny and politics of personal insult lost him Collins, Murkowski and finally McCain.\nIt will get worse\nWe shouldn't elect aberrations.",

As you stress tissue, the body goes into a natural process of creating new cells making you larger. The question is not whether permanent enlargement is possible but instead, how do you safely stress penile tissue to promote cell growth? The answers can be found by looking up Magnum Rings on Facebook or online.",

Remember that when the LCBO started, organised crime was deeply entrenched in the liquor business, too.\n.\nThe proper role of government in a market economy is to address market failures.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

People can use each other, people can have sex thinking only of their own pleasure, people can abuse or rape. Those are perversions. Anal intercourse or oral sex are not perversions as long as both partners are willing and enjoy it. \n\nThe ideal, however, is that sexual activity be between two monogamous people who love each other.

The world has moved on since 1962. So has the Church.\n\nThis debate is fundamentally about ecclesiology, not liturgy. Let's weed the biretta-boys out of the seminaries and close any seminaries that are still teaching the toxic doctrine that a priest is 'ontologically superior' to a layperson.\n\nIf you were to attend Solemn Mass at The Oratory in London (where one of my uncles was a priest for 25 years), you would think you were attending a pre-Vatican II Mass. In fact, it is a modern Roman Mass celebrated in Latin with traditional ceremonial including fiddle-back chasubles, lace albs and birettas. Few Catholics under 60 would know the difference.",

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

The state forgave some of my Alaska Student Loan in exchange for me spending my weekends and evenings on my students' writing so that they could write clearly--and perhaps, therefore, think clearly.  It was a fair bargain, I hope.  I drove a crappy, cold Dodge Colt to work and burned wood for heat.  I paid Alaska State income tax.  My pension is skinny.  My mortgage is nil because I built my houses out of pocket. So I get it that some Alaskans younger than I face massive student debt and unmanageable insurance premiums, as well as stagnant wages.  But does the hardship that younger Alaskans face mean we should burn through our state's savings accounts until there's nothing left?  If we do that (call this the legislative approach) those younger Alaskans will be even worse off.  Walker did what he could with the tools the legislature--that has done precious little to fix the problem--left him.  He's the statesman, the adult in the room, whether popular or not.",

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

They can own commercial property or purpose built rental housing, but there's not reason a non-resident needs to or should be allowed to own a residence.  This is such a boneheaded simple solution to the \"foreign\" problem it makes me want to yank my hair out that it's not even being discussed.  They want to own property here? Buy up rental housing and rent it out.  Makes them money, they get to own property, we get a place to live.  Done.\n\n2) Cap the primary residence cap gains exemption at $250K.

Nelson Mandela was also ANC, but had the capacity to recognise that the communist philosophy vaunted in the bush was not going to get the ANC near the seats of power and the bush war was no longer tenable because their Soviet supporters had bitten the dust. He along with the old guard brokered a good deal  for themselves that led to the depredations of a Zuma.

Four kittens from that colony (b-b-but I thought these colonies were supposed to be spayed/neutered!) got rabies from a raccoon attracted to the food put out for them, and the idiot \"care-takers\" foisted the kittens on a local pet shop which sold them to different households.  Cost the town nearly $2 million to treat those exposed.  Otherwise it could have been 665 horrible DEATHS.\n\nThanks to these \"no-kill\" nitwits and TNR charlatans, cats have accounted for one-third of all human rabies exposures in the US for the last 22 years (Gerhold & Jessup, 2012).",

Theologians were arguing against the exegesis just as vigorously as legislators were arguing against legal racism. \n\nUnfortunately, re gay marriage, the theologians are lagging behind the legislators, and it is this sad fact that renders on-going gay discrimination in the name of religious conscience not exactly the same thing. \n\nThose of us who reject the religious arguments against gay marriage must be very careful, it seems to me, that we do not end up arguing that the law need not take religious conscience into account. As long formal religion continues to reject gay marriage, there is, it seems to me, very sadly, a need to respect bigoted but honest consciences. Sad!!",

Such a judgmental statement is in ignorance of how anyone and everyone chooses to marry: it is out of love, and one way that love is expressed is through the intimacy of sexual union.  Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility.",

This removes disincentives to forego critical work that is poorly remunerated - including activities such as; low paying yet necessary procedures, medical school teaching, administrative work, and research. The latter pay a fraction of what more lucrative clinical activities would. \n\nThe tax change leaves us with 3 options; 1) take a haircut   2)dissolve group arrangements so that we can each benefit from a small business tax deduction   3) reduce time spent on poorly paid activities.

It gets a criminal off the street before they murder a law-abiding citizen for enough petty cash to get their 'fix', so they can go shoot up in a public restroom and feel all-better again.

In that case Chancellor Angela Merkel is a racist, xenophobic, bigoted, Islamophobic leader of Germany notwithstanding the fact Germany has been the most generous country on earth, or at least the most generous country in the western world, in assisting millions of migrants and refugees in recent years.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel stated recently that the full-face veil is incompatible with German values and against integration and should be banned.\n.\n\nI notice my Facebook-feed is full of people who are just itching to condemn people as racists, bigots, Islamophobes, etc, for the slightest deviation from, shall we say (for want of a better term), extreme political correctness.",

Actually, legally it may have been. But I don't think of it as a crime. Women used to experience this kind of stuff all the time.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

The issue is that these nurses were not looking at this man's genitals for medical purposes. They were doing it because they wanted to, to satisfy a personal desire. The article is not, \"Nurses open body bag to examine strange growths on a patient's genitals\" or something along those lines. This is not a case of medical intrigue, what it is, is a case of nurses using their position to take advantage of a patient - dead or alive.

Does this mean he couldn't understand or represent the black experience, as some American blacks argued to be the case? Skin colour or apparent race isn't the sole determinant of identity. Perhaps all  multigenerational North Americans should take one of those DNA ancestry tests that are advertised on television.. Many of us are probably much more diverse than we might imagine. Genealogical research into my family's background has uncovered some surprising facts, including that we had a  great grandmother who was of Portuguese descent.

Of course, he was also different in his incredible ability to heal.

Something will bite Trump in the ass and result in something hurting the US on an international level, and result in fallout on the international level. Take your pick what this is? NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

We used charts showing how much the price of nat gas had risen since the early 70's and projected that 30 years into the future to justify the cost.  But in 1983, the deregulated price of nat gas led production to meet demand, and the price has been coming down as fast as those solar panels came off the rooftops.

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

After looking at both their twitter feeds two things stand out. Anger at anything white and the lack of a male role model in childhood. Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families. Perhaps these two need a dose of reality, that all people have difficulties in life, that there are two choices, 1) to be angry and blame others or 2) rise up from emotionalism rhetoric and become a leader.",

I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

When one does not try to understand the other person, notwithstanding maintaining disagreement, there is no meaningful point to criticizing those views.  \n\nYou have spent considerable time and effort to disparage views that you do not want to understand.  This seems to be a pointless pursuit.   \n\nJehovah's Witnesses, at least those who practice this faith, believe themselves to be \"honest hearted\" ones as defined in the Bible.  Those who see the world to be not as they would expect it's creator to have made it. Those who are \"sighing and groaning over the detestable things\" they see around them, not accepting and not believing men have the power to correct the problems.  Those who do not see themselves as the center of the universe but rather believe there to be a creator worth searching for.",

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

It's time for them to be professionals, do their jobs, and stop falling for this cr*p each and every time, because it isn't going to stop.

No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.

When I got to her home, she was accompanied by a local Rape Relief representative.  As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

They gave up Kyle Turris to Nashville in this trade whose offensive production is just slightly below Duchene's but is a much better two-way player. For Sakic to get a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd round pick plus 3 young players and a throw in back up goalie is amazing. The Girard kid they got from Nashville is only 19 and was playing at this very young age as a defensemen on one of the best teams in the league. He scored over a point a game in major juniors which for a d-man is very good. In his first 5 games for Nashville he was already producing scoring a goal and having 2 assists.
